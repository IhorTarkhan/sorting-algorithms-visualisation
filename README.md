# Sorting algorithms visualisation

## IT-AD team

### Small desktop application to real-life demonstrate complexity of sorting algorithms.

##### - The file where the program starts: main.py

##### - Here you can see a form, where you can input the parameters of the array (min, max, array size and if it is preordered in some way) which is going to be sorted by six algorithms

#### Six algorithms we used:
                        1) Brick
                        2) Buble
                        3) Cocktail
                        4) Merge
                        5) Quick
                        6) Insertion

##### - Then you can ran choose between running one sample and all our experience which is stored in database


##### - If you opt for one sample, it will show you two diagrams of time and memory consumption

#### If you opt for all experience it will show you six graph:
                                        1) time consumtion of the array wich was precompiled in ascending order from number of elements
                                        2) time consumtion of the array wich was precompiled in random order from number of elements
                                        3) time consumtion of the array wich was precompiled in descending order from number of elements
                                        4) memory usage the array wich was precompiled in ascending order from number of elements
                                        5) memory usage the array wich was precompiled in random order from number of elements
                                        6) memory usage the array wich was precompiled in descending order from number of elements

#### Paterns we used:
